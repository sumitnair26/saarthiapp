### Keeping your fork up-to-date


If you are using command-line you can do the following:

1. `git remote add codeigniter git://github.com/sumitnair26/saarthiapp.git`
2. `git pull saarthiapp develop`
3. `git push origin develop`

Now your fork is up to date. This should be done regularly, or before you send a pull request at least.
